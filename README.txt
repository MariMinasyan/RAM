Monopoly Game

How to run:
For simplicity, you can create a new project in your IDE and add the source code, along with the rest of the provided files to that new project (otherwise you will need to specify the root directory as CLASSPATH). The board configuration file, stored in data.txt, must be located at the root directory, e.g., where the directory "out" is placed (it becomes the classpath when the program is run). If the project includes UI resources (such as a game logo), they should also be placed at the same root level to be accessible during runtime. You can overwrite the runtime parameters in main() by uncommenting the indicated line. Doing so results in permanent command-line interface (CLI) launch. Otherwise, runtime arguments passed to main() will determine whether the program is launched in UI or CLI mode.
